# The Complete Networking Fundamentals Course. My CCNA start

This is my collections on Udemy's Course [The Complete Networking Fundamentals Course. Your CCNA start](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/).

It is easier for me to memorize the course by making some notes and publish them on github.

I practice the course on Ubuntu Jammy with Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.2.1.

I am still not finished yet. I am still on the course. I will make a note after I finishing one section.

Hopefully this concise notes will help you to study ccna.

>You must have a basic networking to keep with my notes because I almost skip the simple section.
